# Arduino-Robot
This is a project which contains code for controlling a robot using processing. There is also a server which logs movements in an Access DB.

## How to use:

- Download processing
- Download Arduino
- Using an Arduino Uno card, branch the pieces you have (can be any, as long as you can build something that rolls).
- Modify the Arduino server so that it fits your needs
- Compile it and transfer it on the card.
- Create an Access database and create the tables to your needs.
- Modify/customize the Processing server so that it uploads to the right tables/columns.
- Run the processing client and control!
